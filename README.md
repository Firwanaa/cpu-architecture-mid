### 1- What is the von Neumann Model/architecture?

Most computers use the stored program concept designed by mathematician John Von Neumann, which is a theoretical design describes the basic structure and functional units of a computer system. computers has five parts, an arithmetic-logic unit(ALU), control unit (CU), memory, input/output and system bus. 

- #### Types of Bus:
	- 16 - bit data bus -> read and write *usually used to classify microprocessors i.e, 16-bit microprocessors.*
	- 20 - bit address bus -> transmit registers addresses
	- 20 - bit control bus -> control the functions of other buses.

### 2- When was the Von Neumann architecture invented?
1946

### 3- Has the Von Neumann Architecture been changed till recently?
The architecture still wildly used, very few use the pure model, most computers add another step to check for interrupts, electronic events that could occur any time.
it has seen many advancements such as pipelining, the introduction of RISC, parallel processing, power optimisation and many other things to improve performance and efficiency. Even though quantum computing is introduced recently it's still limited to lab use and still not production ready. 

### 4- Which computers are made from The von Neumann Model? 
The majority of computers like PC, laptops and mobile phones are based on Von Neumann model. Two
