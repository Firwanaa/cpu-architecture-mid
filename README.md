### 1- What is the von Neumann Model/architecture?

Most computers use the stored program concept designed by mathematician John Von Neumann, which is a theoretical design describes the basic structure and functional units of a computer system. computers has five parts, an arithmetic-logic unit(ALU), control unit (CU), memory, input/output and system bus. 

Additions
- #### Types of Bus:
	- data bus -> read and write *usually used to classify microprocessors i.e, 16-bit microprocessors.*
	- address bus -> transmit registers addresses
	- control bus -> control the functions of other buses.

### 2- When was the Von Neumann architecture invented?
1946

### 3- Has the Von Neumann Architecture been changed till recently?
The architecture still wildly used, very few use the pure model, most computers add another step to check for interrupts, electronic events that could occur any time.
it has seen many advancements such as pipelining, the introduction of RISC, parallel processing, power optimisation and many other things to improve performance and efficiency. Even though quantum computing is introduced recently it's still limited to lab use and still not production ready. 

### 4- Which computers are made from The von Neumann Model? 
The majority of computers like PC, laptops and mobile phones are based on Von Neumann model. Most intel and AMD processors are based on Von Neumann, but very few used the pure model. 

### 5- Provide the actions that a Von Newmann computer emulate.

- **instruction fetch**: obtain instructions from storage
- **instruction decode**: determine required actions and instruction size.
- **operand fetch**: locate and obtain operand data.
- **execute**: compute results 
- **result store**: deposit result into storage for later use
- **next instruction**: determine successor instruction
